Here is config file we built for one of our customers with very unusual 
Digipass token and password requirements. Some of you may be interested in 
this technique: it is an interesting way to increase the security level of an 
existing static password based system.

The customer wanted to use both Digipass tokens _and_ LDAP for authentication. 
The users password had to consist of 6 digits of Digipass tokencode (no PIN) 
followed by the static password for their LDAP database, eg:

742696fred

The attached config file shows how you can use AuthBy INTERNAL hooks to adjust 
the decoded password before AuthBy DIGIPASS runs, and then readjust the 
decoded password before the second AuthBy runs. The result is that AuthBy  
DIGIPASS only sees the first 6 characters of the submitted password, and the 
last AuthBy only sees the characters after the 6th.
