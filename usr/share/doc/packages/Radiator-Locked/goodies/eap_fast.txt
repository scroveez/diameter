This document describes how to enable suport for EAP-FAST in Radaitor
4.8+patches, as at September 2011.

EAP-FAST is an EAP authentication protocol invented by Cisco and documented in
RFC 4851 and draft-cam-winget-eap-fast-provisioning-04. It is similar to TTLS
and PEAP, in that it establishes a TLS tunnel over Radius, and through the
tunnel, inner EAP authentication protocols (such as EAP-MSCHAPV2 or EAP-GTC)
can be used to authenticate the user. In contrast to TTLS and PEAP, there is a
mechanism for establishing and distributing Protected Access Credentials
(PACs) from a Radius server to 802.1X supplicants. These PACS are basically
reusable keys to allow EAP-FAST sessions to be reestablished securely.

Radiator 3.17.1+patches and later versions support EAP-FAST, 
but in order to do so, it requires
a number of recently added features in OpenSSL and Net-SSLeay. OSC provides a
precompiled Net::SSLeay+OpenSSL+EAP-FAST-patches bundles for Linux and
Windows.


The rest of this document describes how to install EAP-FAST support in
Radiator.

1. If you intend to run Radiator on i386 Linux (32 bit) with Perl 5.8.7, download
   and install the precompiled RPM with:
   rpm -Uvh  http://www.open.com.au/radiator/free-downloads/Net-SSLeay-1.32-1.i386.rpm
   goto step 5

2. Otherwise, if you intend to run Radiator on x86 Windows with ActiveState
   ActivePerl 5.6 or 5.8, download and install the precompiled PPD with
   ppm install http://www.open.com.au/radiator/free-downloads/Net-SSLeay.ppd
   goto step 5

3. Else you must build and install OpenSSL with Jouni Malinen's Session Secret
   patches.

   Jouni Malinenen, as part of the wpa_supplicant project has made patches for
   OpenSSL that add support for a new SSL_set_session_secret_cb, which is
   required for EAP-FAST support. Patches are available for OpenSSL 0.9.8d,
   0.9.8e and the currently under development 0.9.9-dev. Patches are available
   here in the Radiator goodies directory as:
   openssl-0.9.8d-session-ticket-osc.patch
   openssl-0.9.8e-session-ticket-osc.patch
   openssl-0.9.8i-tls-extensions.patch
   openssl-0.9.9-session-ticket.patch
   The 0.9.9 patch installs cleanly against the 0.9.9-dev snapshot in
   openssl-SNAP-20070816.tar.gz.

   The preferred version is currently the latest stable verison 0.9.8i
   In order to build OpenSSL with these patches, do something like:
   tar zxvf openssl-0.9.8i.tar.gz
   cd openssl-0.9.8i
   (if using GCC4.2 see below)
   patch -p 1 < ../openssl-0.9.8i-tls-extensions.patch
   Then compile and install OpenSSL as per the instructions in the OpenSSL
   INSTALL file. You must use the enable-tlsext flag:
   ./config enable-tlsext ...whatever....
   make
   make install

   It is hoped and expected that these patches will be incorporated into the
   OpenSSL mainline soon. (As at 2011-09-24, they stillhave not been
   incorporated into OPneSSL 1.0.)
   goto step 4

   Hint: if you are building openssl 0.9.8e or earlier with GCC4.2, you will
   need to apply openssl-0.9.8e-gcc42.patch (from
   http://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=119315 among other places), else
   you wil get crashes with 'Illegal instruction'. 
   Apply the patch before openssl-0.9.8e-session-ticket-osc.patch

4. Then build and install Net-SSLeay

   tar zxvf Net-SSLeay-1.40.tar.gz
   cd Net-SSLeay-1.40
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

   goto step 5


   (Caution: Net-SSLeay 1.32 does not include support for the 
   SSL_set_session_secret_cb,
   and requires patching too with this comand:
   patch -p 1 <../net-ssleay-1.32-session-ticket.patch
   This patch is not required for Net-SSLeay 1.33 and later (available at CPAN
   www.cpan.org)
   )
   Hint: On some 64 bit Linux distros (eg Red Hat EL5), you may get link
   errors from Net-SSLeay. In this case, you need to rebuild openssl as
   shared (./config -shared), and then rebuild Net-SSLeay. You may also need
   to specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/ssl/lib when you run Radiator so it
   finds the OpenSSL shared library.

5. Configure Radiator to use EAP-FAST.

   Support for EAP-FAST is included in the 3.17.1 full source patch set, and
   in later versions of Radiator. For 3.17.1, use the full source distribution
   and the patch set. EAP-FAST is not available for the 3.17.1 RPM and binary
   distributions):

   tar zxvf Radiator-4.8.tgz 
   cd Radiator-4.8
   perl Makefile.PL 
   .... etc as per Radiator installation instructions.

   Configuring Radiator for EAP-FAST is similar to configuring for EAP-TTLS or
   EAP-PEAP support. EAP-FAST can also be supported alongside other
   EAP authentication protocols simultaneously.
   The only extra configuration parameter required is EAPTLS_DHFile which must
   specify a Diffie Helman parameters file. A suitable DH params file is
   included in dh2048.pem in the certificates directory in your Radiator
   distribution. This file is known to work with Odyssey Access Client
   Manager, which is very picky about the DH params it will accept.
   EAPTLS_DHFile %D/certificates/dh2048.pem

   Some optional parameters allow you to configure the PAC 
   There is a sample configuration file that shows how to configure for just
   EAP-FAST support in goodies/eap_fast.cfg in your configuration. And
   goodies/eap_multi.cfg shows one way to configure multiple EAP protocol suport,
   including EAP-FAST.

   Radiator EAP-FAST has been tested against the following supplicants:
   Juniper Odyssey Acccess Client Manager 4.60.49455.0
   Cisco Secure Services Client 4.2.0.6187
   wpa_supplicant 0.6.0 and 0.7.3
