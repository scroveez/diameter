Integrating Radiator and Mera MVTS Pro VOIP Gateways

This document briefly outlines the requirements for interfacing Radiator with
Mera MVTS Pro VOIP gateways, along with examples of the types of requests and
replies Radiator can be expected to handle when interfacing with MVTS Pro.

Mera sell a range of VOIP gateways suporting SIP and H323.  Mera have changed
their name in 2010 to ALOE Systems (http://www.aloe-systems.com)

The MVTS Pro VOIP gateway can interface with a RADIUS server for call
authorization, accounting and call routing.

Pre-routing Call Authorization
------------------------------

The MVTS Pro sends the RADIUS server this type of authorization request before
forwarding the call to destination along the selected path.

Radiator replies with Tariff information, and other information to be used by
the gateways for the call.

The User-Name in this  Access-Request is the IP address of the MVTS Pro gateway, and
the Password is hard configured in the MVTS Pro, and defaults to 'xpgk'. (Note
thiat this password does not authenticate and end user, it authenticates the
gatway. The User-Name is the Gateway IP Address)

This type of request is identified by the attribute:
     cisco-avpair = "xpgk-request-type=number"

The Access-Accept must contain at least an h323-return-code=0
attribute. However this is encoded in an unusual way. It is encoded as text in
a cisco-h323-return-code RADIUS attribute. Thats not an error: the entire text
'h323-return-code=0' is encoded in a cisco-h323-return-code reply attribute.

The Access-Accept can also contain other attributes to control details of the
call and its accounting, such as the Tariff to use, the amount of credit or
time left etc.
These other attributes are often encoded in a similarly unusual way, with the
h323 attribute name encoded in cisco-avpair or cisco-h323-* attributes.

See the MVTS Pro Administrators Guide for more details.

You will probably want to configure your Radiator to look up a tariff based on
the attributes in the Access-Request.

As a simple example, you might configure a sample authorisation for a gateway
with address 123.243.248.119 in a Radiator flat user file
record like this:

123.243.248.119	User-Password = xpgk
        cisco-h323-billing-model = "h323-billing-model=0",
        cisco-avpair = "h323-ivr-in=Tariff:CC-SipSubscribers",
        cisco-avpair = "h323-ivr-in=DURATION:10000",
        cisco-h323-return-code = "h323-return-code=0",
        cisco-h323-currency-type = "h323-currency=AUD",
        cisco-h323-credit-time = "h323-credit-time=10000",
        cisco-h323-preferred-lang = "h323-preferred-lang=en"


An incoming authorisation Access-Request from an MVTS Pro might look like this:

*** Received from 123.243.248.123 port 39908 ....

        cisco-avpair = "h323-incoming-conf-id=9EE1298E DA4811DF A3C60013 21D425F8"
        cisco-avpair = "h323-call-id=9EE1298E DA4811DF A3C60013 21D425F8"
        cisco-h323-remote-address = "h323-remote-address=123.243.248.121"
        cisco-avpair = "xpgk-dst-number-in=61288881111"

        cisco-avpair = "xpgk-src-number-in=6129861111"

And a successful authorisation Access-Accept from the sample user record above
might look like this:

Code:       Access-Accept
Identifier: 0
Authentic:  pz<132>#<240><225>3<130><247><191>bS9*Jb
Attributes:

        cisco-avpair = "h323-ivr-in=Tariff:CC-SipSubscribers"

        cisco-h323-credit-time = "h323-credit-time=10740"
        cisco-h323-preferred-lang = "h323-preferred-lang=en"


Call Accounting
---------------

The MVTS Pro sends the RADIUS server the Accounting Start record upon arrival
of a call (incoming leg) or on sending SETUP to the destination gateway
(outgoing leg).

The MVTS Pro sends the RADIUS server the Accounting Stop record on call
termination.

These are called CDRs (Call Detail Records) by MVTS Pro.

You will probably want to configure your Radiator to record some or all of the
details from such accounting requests, perhaps to an SQL database. This is a
straightforward task that is described elsewhere in the Radiator
documentation.

This is what a sample Accounting-Request Start from the authorization above
would look like:

Code:       Accounting-Request

        cisco-avpair = "h323-gw-address=123.243.248.119"
        cisco-h323-connect-time = "h323-connect-time=23:45:32.465 UTC Sun Oct 17 2010"
        cisco-h323-setup-time = "h323-setup-time=23:45:28.930 UTC Sun Oct 17 2010"

Call Routing
------------

The MVTS Pro sends a routing Access-Request when the gateway, acting as a
terminator, is marked as RADIUS routing server.

The reply is expeted a list of routing options for termination of the call at
its destination point. In addition the RADIUS server can also change the
username and password for the call in question.

The MVTS Pro can handle several route options sequentially attempting every
next route after a successful call termination if the previous one proves
impossible.

This type of request is identified by the attribute:
     cisco-avpair = "xpgk-request-type=route"

This type is somewhat similar to the authorisation request and reply from
above, but the reply includes a number of Cisco-Command-Code attributes
containing routing options which the MVTS Pro will try in sequence. The text
of each Cisco-Command-Code is in a special XPGK_XROUTING_ROUTING format which
is documented in the MVTS Pro Administrator's Guide, but which is briefly:

gateway/proxy_mode/source/dest/src_bill/dst_bill/ip-address[:port]/converter/extra

where:
gateway – GW name from the Equipment record;
proxy_mode – mode of proxy operation:
       0 – media proxying disabled.
       1 – media proxying enabled.
       2 – use proxying mode of originating gateway.
       3 - use proxying mode of terminating gateway.
source – calling number (src_number).
dest – called party number that will be sent to the terminating gateway (dst_number).
src_bill – calling number for the billing system.
dst_bill – called number for the billing system.
ip-address[:port] – IP address for connection (port number is optional).
converter – name of the record for the converter through which the call is to be terminated.
extra – extra parameters.

If route authorization fails, or if the appropriate routes coould not be
determined, Radiator should reply with an Access-Reject.

The incoming Access-Request for a looks like this:

Authentication of registering devices
-------------------------------------

When an end device (phone or user) is being registered, MVTS Pro sends an
Access-Request with the attribute:
 cisco-avpair = "xpgk-request-type=user"

The Access-Request may be a conventional PAP, CHAP or SIP Digest
authentication, all of which Radiator will handle automatically. MVTS Pro can
also send a type of MD5 authentication with the MD5 hash encoded in an
xpgk-md5-auth attribute. This last type is not supported by Radiator.

In the following example, MVTS Pro sends a RADIUS PAP authentication request
for user '1122':

Code:       Access-Request
Identifier: 204
Authentic:  <176>N<194>U<202><220>z<8><178><2><243>m<193>=<246><143>
Attributes:
        User-Password = <31><9><165>9<248>`es@.<149><132>!<201><232><134>
        NAS-IP-Address = 123.243.248.123
        User-Name = "1122"
        Service-Type = Login-User
        cisco-avpair = "xpgk-request-type=user"
        NAS-Port-Type = Async


The Access-Accept must include the h323-return-code=0 attribute. Other
optional reply attributes are also permitted, as in the follwoing example.

Code:       Access-Accept
Identifier: 204
Authentic:  <200>u<15><215>z<242>A<231><26><130><14><190><23>V<160><169>

        cisco-avpair = "h323-ivr-in=Tariff:CC-SipSubscribers"
        cisco-avpair = "h323-ivr-in=available-funds:9.90"
        cisco-h323-return-code = "h323-return-code=0"
        cisco-h323-currency-type = "h323-currency=AUD"
        cisco-h323-preferred-lang = "h323-preferred-lang=en"
