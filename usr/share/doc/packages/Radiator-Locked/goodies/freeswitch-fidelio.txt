This document discusses how to use Radiator and the AuthBy FIDELIO module to
handle authentication and accounting for the Freeswitch VOIP switch
(http://www.freeswitch.org). It can be used authenticate and to bill VOIP
calls to a Micros-Fidelio Opera Hotel Property Management System
(http://www.micros.com).

Freeswitch is a very configurable, open source, free Multi-Protocol Soft
Switch that runs on Linux, Windows and other operating systems.

Micros-Fidelio Opera is a widely used commercial Hotel Property Management
System, which is supported by Radiator RADIUS Server.

The goal of this sample configuration is to implement a user-pays VOIP system
in a hotel environment:
Before a user can make a call from a hotel room VOIP phone, there must be
someone checked into the room. When the call is completed, the call is billed
to the hotel room.

In this scenario, every VOIP phone in each room is configured so that
the phone registers as the Opera room number.

In order to achive this, Freeswitch must be compiled with the mod_perl
and mod_radius_cdr modules. To do this, follow the instructions at:
http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_radius_cdr
http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_perl

Dont forget to edit mod_radius_cdr.conf.xml and set the acctserver lines to
the address, port and shared secret of your Radiator RADIUS server host. After
you do this, and restart freeswitch, freeswitch will send RADIUS accounting
data before and after each call.

CAUTION: if Freeswitch is configured with mod_radius_cdr and if none of the
RADIUS accounting servers configured into the mod_radius_cdr acctserver lines
is contactable, no calls can be completed.

I order to verify that someone is checked in to a room before a call is
permitted, you need to edit your Freeswitch dialplan (typically in
/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/dialplan/default.xml) and add a line like this to
the extension clause for the type of calls you wish to check:

<action application="perl" data="/usr/local/freeswitch/scripts/freeswitch-fidelio.pl"/>

The freeswitch-fidelio.pl script is provided in the Radiator goodies
directory. Copy it to /usr/local/freeswitch/scripts/ on the freeswitch host
and restart freeswitch. 

For example, in the sample dialplan/default.xml provided with freeswitch is an
extension clause for playing some tones when you dial 9198. As a test, you can add the
application="perl" line so that there must be someone checked in to the room
before they can call the 9198 number.
(In production you would add the application="perl" line to any destination
numbers that you wish to restrict to rooms where there is a user checked in,
such as external outbound calls.)

    <extension name="tone_stream">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^9198$">
         <action application="perl" data="/usr/local/freeswitch/scripts/freeswitch-fidelio.pl"/>
        <action application="log" data="INFO  AUTH_RESULT=${AUTH_RESULT}"/>

        <action application="answer"/>
        <action application="playback" data="tone_stream://path=${base_dir}/conf/tetris.ttml;loops=10"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>

The freeswitch-fidelio.pl script uses the Radius::SimpleClient modules that
are part of Radiator, so it requires Radiator to be installed on the
Freeswitch host (but it does not _require_ the Radiator server to be running on
the Freeswitch host: it can be anywhere in your network)

Now configure your Radiator server with the sample freeswitch-fidelio.cfg from
the Radiator goodies directory. Edit freeswitch-fidelio.cfg and set the Host
to be the address of the Micros-Fidelio Opera server, which has previously
been configured with Radiator support. See your Micros-Fidelio representative
for details on how to have the Radiator support option installed in your Opera
system.

For testing, you can use the goodies/fideliosim.pl simulator for simulating
Micros-Fidelio Opera. Use the ci and co commands in the simulator to check
simulated guests in and out of the room numbers correspnding to your test
phone numbers.

The sample freeswitch-fidelio.cfg will accept authentication requests if there
is someone checked into the room according to Opera, and when accounting
requests are received for completed outbound calls, it will add charges
for completed calls to the room.

Consider these sample scripts as a starting point for the specific
requirements for your VOIP hotel billing.

Tested with Radiator 4.8 on Ubuntu 10.10 with Freeswitch 1.0.7

---------------------
Here is a sample Radiator log showing a typical internal call to a recorded
tone that is authenticated by
freeswitch-fidelio.pl in Freeswitch and freeswitch-fidelio.cfg in Radiator:
It shows:
Accounting Start for the originating caller room 1001 to the 9198 tone stream
example from above.
Authentication of the room/phone (Radiator checks there is someone checked
into room 1001 agaionst the Fidelio database)
Accounting Stop showing a total call time of 79 seconds (this was not posted
to Fidelio because it was not an outbound call)

An call to another phone would also show accounting records for the inbound leg to the
destination phone.
