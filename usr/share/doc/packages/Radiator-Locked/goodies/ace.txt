This is a brief description of how to install, configure and test
Radiator with RSA Authentication Manager (formerly SecurID ACE/Server).

By following these instructions, Radiator will authenticate directly
to an RSA Authentication Manager. It is also possible for Radiator
successfully to proxy Radius requests to the optional RSA Radius
server using AuthBy RADIUS.

These instructions are for Authentication Manager Version 7.1 and
later. Note: version 8.x is a virtual appliance whereas 7.1 is
separate software.

Radiator also supports the more recent web based API to Authentication
Manager 7.1 and later, through the AuthBy RSAAM module. It provides
additional features and you may want to consider using that instead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation on Windows 7, 8, Server 2003, 2003R2, 2008, 2008R2, 2012:

0. Purchase and download the Radiator software distribution from Open
   System Consultants (http://www.open.com.au/radiator). The software is provided as a
   self-extracting .exe file, which will install the distribution in C:\Radiator.
1. Install ActivePerl 5.16 from Active State (http://www.activestate.com) or
   Strawberry Perl 5.16 from (http://www.strawberryperl.com)
2. Install RSA Authentication Manager following the RSA installation instructions:
   Install 7.1 on the RSA Server host, or
   Install 8.x virtual appliance
3. Log in to RSA AM web interface (RSA Security Console)
   a. import test token details into RSA AM database.
   b. create an Authentication Agent with type 'Standard Agent' using
      the IP address and Windows hostname of your Radiator host. The
      hostname *must* match Windows hostname. If the Radiator host is
      not the same as the RSA Server host, create the sdconf.rec file
      and copy it to C:\Windows\System32 on the Radiator host.
   c. create a test user
   d. assign the test token to the test user
   e. by default the test user should be allowed to use the Authentcation Agent.
4. Install the precompiled Authen-ACE4 module, which is included in the
   standard Radiator distribution:
   ppm install file://c:path/to/your/radiator/dist/ppm/Authen-ACE4.ppd
5. Start Radiator test server from within the distribution directory.
   You must use command prompt that has administrator rights:
   perl radiusd -config_file goodies/ace.cfg -trace 4
6. Test Radius authentication as described below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation on Unix

0. Purchase and download the Radiator software distribution from Open
   System Consultants (http://www.open.com.au/radiator). The software is provided as a
   .tgz file, which can be unpacked with tar, using a command like:
   tar zxvf Radiator-4.12.tgz. Unpack it to a
   working directory such as /usr/local/src/Radiator on the Radiator Host.
1. Ensure a recent version of Perl is installed on the Radiator Host.
   5.8.8 or later is recommended.
   For Solaris, use a precompiled Perl package from
   http://www.sunfreeware.com.  Also ensure that a complete 'C'
   compilation environment is installed. For Solaris, use GCC from
   http://www.sunfreeware.com. You may also consider using Oracle
   Solaris Studio and Perlbrew as an alternative Perl installation method.
2. Install RSA Authentication Manager following the RSA installation instructions:
   Install 7.1 on the RSA Server host, or
   Install 8.x virtual appliance
3. Obtain "RSA Authentication Agent API 8.1 SP2 for C"
   AuthSDK_C_v8.1.1.109.06_03_11_03_16_51.zip or later from
   https://knowledge.rsasecurity.com using your RSA support contract details.
4. Log in to RSA AM web interface (RSA Security Console)
   a. import test token details into RSA AM database.
   b. create an Authentication Agent with type 'Standard Agent' using
      the IP address and hostname of your Radiator host. The hostname
      *must* match and must be assigned to the outgoing interface IP.
   c. create a test user
   d. assign the test token to the test user
   e. by default the test user should be allowed to use the Authentcation Agent.
   f. if the Radiator host is remote, create an sdconf.rec file for
      the Authentication Agent and copy it to the VAR_ACE directory as
      defined by Radiator configuration file option ConfigDirectory.
5. Download Authen-ACE4-1.4.tar.gz or later from your nearest CPAN archive 
   (search.cpan.org) or http://www.open.com.au/radiator/free-downloads.
6. Unpack, configure, build and install Authen-ACE4 as described
   in the INSTALL file in the Authen-ACE4 distribution.
7. Start Radiator test server from within the distribution directory:
   perl radiusd -config_file goodies/ace.cfg -trace 4
8. Test Radius authentication as described below.

Hints

If you are unable to get anything other than Access Denied, try running
the ACE/Server log monitor on the ACE Server host, 
which can help tell you what the problem is.

Common problems are:
1. RSA AM requires that the hostname on the client be the same as the
   Host Name entered for the Agent in Authentication Manager. Further
   it is necessary that the client's hosts database (typically
   /etc/hosts) only has one entry for the hostname and that entry is
   for the same address as the external address as entered into the
   Agent in Authentication Manager. This can be a problem with some
   versions of Ubuntu for example which add multple entries into
   /etc/hosts, including one for 127.0.1.1. You will need to delete
   any such entries.
2. Token is in New PIN mode: next time, use _just_ the digits from the
   token code. The number of digits is typically 6 or 8, depending on the token.
3. ACE authentication engine not running on RSA AM 7.1 server:
   a. On Windows, use the Windows Services window to start the engine
   b. On Unix, start the ACE server, and make sure it starts automatically
   at boot time.
4. Radiator host is behind a NAT device, resulting in inability to
   authenticate. RSA Server cannot validate requests, since they appear to
   come from a different IP address (is the NAT device address) to the actual
   Agent address:
   On the Radiator host, create a sdopts.rec file containing a line like:
   CLIENT_IP=1.2.3.4
   (where 1.2.3.4 is the IP address of the NAT device ie the apparent address
   of the Radiator host, as seen by the RSA Server). Save the file in the
   appropriate place for your platform (see the RSA documentation, but on
   Windows its generally C:\Windows\System32, and on Unix in the VAR_ACE
   directory (configuration file option ConfigDirectory).
5. If your Radiator host is multihomed (ie has more than one IP address) you may
   need to add an sdopts.rec as per item 4. Note that installing VMWare (and
   maybe other applications) can add
   new internal IP addresses to your host, even if you only have one ethernet
   connection adn one LAN address.
6. You can enable tracing within the RSA aceclnt library by setting the
   RSATRACELEVEL environment variable to 65535 when running Radiator. Tracing is
   to stdout by default. RSATRACEDEST environment variable specifies the
   location and name of the SecurID log file. If this isnâ€™t defined, output
   will go to stdout. On Windows, you can use the RSA Security Centre to
   enable tracing in the Troubleshooting section.
7. If you change the AM node secret or install a new sdconf.rec, you will need
   to delete the old node secret file and status files sdstatus.12 and securid
   in the VAR_ACE directory, to force AM and the ACE Agent to renegotiate a
   new node secret.
8. If you require load balancing with multiple RSA ACE or RSA Authentication Manager
   servers, you will need to create an sdopts.rec file in the ACE_DATA
   directory as per intructions in the RSA documentation.
9. If you upgrade the version of the RSA Auth Agent API library and rebuild
   Authen-ACE4, it is possible that you will have to delete the sdstatus.12 and 
   securid files in VAR_ACE, otherwise the Auth Agent API will not be able to
   contact the ACE or Authentication Manager server. Symptoms of these are a
   long delays in trying authentication, followed by an 'Access Denied'
   failure.
10. User does not have a host activation for the Radiator host.

Testing Radiator and RSA AM with radpwtst

Here is sample new authentication with the token for user mikem in
'New PIN mode', using radpwtst. Note that the initial password given
is just the current tokencode.

[mikem@zulu Radiator]$ perl radpwtst -noacct -timeout 1000 -interactive -user mikem -password 340977

To continue you must enter a new PIN.
Are you ready to enter a new PIN? (y/n) [n]

Enter a new PIN between 4 and 8 digits:
1234
sending Access-Request...
Re-enter new PIN to confirm:
1234

PIN accepted. Wait for the tokencode to
change, then enter a new PASSCODE:
1234169199
