This document is a brief description of an easy way to obtain
performance data about SQL queries run by your Radiator.

The Perl DBI module includes built-in performance measurement. You can
set certain environment variables and run your program. When the
program exits, it will print out details about the time each of your
SQL queries took to run.

For example, on Unix, you can enable data to be grouped by SQL
statement with a command like:

DBI_PROFILE=2 ./radiusd -config goodies/radmin.cfg
...... program runs
terminate the program with SIG term (use something like 
kill -TERM nnnn 
where nnnn is the Radiator process ID), and the performance data
will be printed on STDOUT, something like this:


DBI::Profile: 14.151900 seconds 23.90% (8466 method calls) radiusd

Other values of DBI_PROFILE are possible. More details with 
man DBI::Profile
