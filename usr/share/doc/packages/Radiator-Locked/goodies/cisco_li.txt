This document describes how t configure Radiator to interoperate with Cisco
RADIUS-Based Lawful Intercept as described in 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6566/products_feature_guide09186a008060de94.html

Some Cisco NAS and Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol access concentrator (LAC) devices
can be configured to start and stop Lawful Intercept taps based on
special attributes in Radius Accept-Accept or Change-Filter-Request(also
called CoA) packets.

The special attribute is cisco-li-configuration in the Radiator dictionary. It
is automatically salt encrypted by Radiator as required by the Cisco spec.

The contents of the cisco-li-configuration attributes allows the Radius server
to enable, disable and configure LawfulIntercept taps. In the following
example, we show what looks like a standard Radius user record to illustrate
the Radius attributes required to enable LI in an Access-Accept.

In this example, the Reply attributes enable an intercept to start:

interceptthisuser     User-Password=whatever
		      cisco-li-configuration="intercept-id=12345678",
		      cisco-li-configuration="li-action=1",
		      cisco-li-configuration="md-ip-addr=1.2.3.4",
		      cisco-li-configuration="md-port=1"

When this user authenticates successfully, an intercept wil be commenced and
sent to the mediation device at the IP address 1.2.3.4. Note that intercept-id
is expected to be a unique 8 digit number to identify the intercept to the
mediation device. Dont use a fixed number. Probably the easiest way to do
this is to use an SQL database as part of your LI user database and setup.

You can use the Radius test clinet in Radiator to send  Change-Filter-Request(also
called CoA) packets to an LI enabled device from the command line (this is one
command, all on one line:

radpwtst -trace 4 -noacct -noauth -code Change-Filter-Request -secret mysecret
 cisco-li-configuration="intercept-id=12345678"
 cisco-li-configuration="li-action=1"
 cisco-li-configuration="md-ip-addr=1.2.3.4" cisco-li-configuration="md-port=1"
 Acct-Session-ID=12345

When sending such a CoA command to the Cisco device, the Acct-Session-ID
identifies the session whose intercept is to be started or stopped.
