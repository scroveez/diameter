# eap_ttls_tnc.cfg
#
# Example Radiator configuration file.
# This configuration file shows how to enable TNC support in Radiator.
# TNC is the Trusted Network Connect specification from Trusted Computing
# Group (https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/specs/TNC). 
# TNC allows 802.1X clients and Radiator to exchange integrity
# measurements so that the client only gets connected to the network if it
# meets the network administratprs requriements for specific versions of
# software etc to be instaled on the client. Tested with xsupplicant 
# (http://open1x.sourceforge.net), the open
# source 802.1X supplicant, which also supports TNC.
# TNC support in Radiator is at alpha level only. It is not easily
# configurable and does not yet work with loadable IMVs.
#
# We suggest you start simple, prove to yourself that it
# works and then develop a more complicated configuration.
#
# This example will authenticate from a standard users file in the
# current directory.  It will accept requests from any client and try
# to handle request for any realm.  And it will print out what its
# doing in great detail.
#
# In order to authenticate, the clients user name must be in ./users 
# (the password is irrelevant for EAP TLS).
# It will also require that the certificate installed on the client
# is within one step of the root certificate, and that the subject name
# in the client certificate is the same as the user name they are trying
# to log in as.
#
# In order to test this, you WILL need to install a server certificate and 
# key for Radiator to use. Runs with openssl on Unix.
#
# See radius.cfg for more complete examples of features and
# syntax, and refer to the reference manual for a complete description
# of all the features and syntax.
#
# Requires Net_SSLeay.pm-1.21 or later
# Requires openssl 0.9.7beta3 or later from www.openssl.org
# Requires Digest-HMAC
# Requires Digest-SHA
#
# You should consider this file to be a starting point only

# The original PEAP request from a NAS will be sent to a matching
# Realm or Handler in the usual way, where it will be unpacked and the inner authentication
# extracted.
# The inner authentication request will be sent again to a matching
# Realm or Handler. The special check item TunnelledByPEAP=1 can be used to select
# a specific handler, or else you can use EAPAnonymous to set a username and realm
# which can be used to select a Realm clause for the inner request.
# This allows you to select an inner authentication method based on Realm, and/or the
# fact that they were tunnelled. You can therfore act just as a PEAP server, or also 
# act as the AAA/H home server, and authenticate PEAP requests locally or proxy
# them to another remote server based on the realm of the inner authenticaiton request.
# In this basic example, both the inner and outer authentication are authenticated

		# EAPTLS_CAFile is the name of a file of CA certificates

		EAPTLS_CAFile %D/certificates/demoCA/cacert.pem

		# EAPTLS_CAPath is the name of a directory containing CA

		# subject name hash value
#		EAPTLS_CAPath

		# EAPTLS_CertificateFile is the name of a file containing
		# the servers certificate. EAPTLS_CertificateType
		# specifies the type of the file. Can be PEM or ASN1
		# defaults to ASN1
		EAPTLS_CertificateFile %D/certificates/cert-srv.pem
		EAPTLS_CertificateType PEM

		# EAPTLS_PrivateKeyFile is the name of the file containing
		# the servers private key. It is sometimes in the same file

		# EAPTLS_MaxFragmentSize sets the maximum TLS fragemt
		# size that will be replied by Radiator. It must be small
		# enough to fit in a single Radius request (ie less than 4096)
		# and still leave enough space for other attributes
		# Aironet APs seem to need a smaller MaxFragmentSize
		# (eg 1024) than the default of 2048. Others need even smaller sizes.

		#EAPTLS_DHFile %D/certificates/dh2048.pem
		#EAPTLS_ECDH_Curve prime256v1

		# If EAPTLS_CRLCheck is set  and the client presents a certificate
		# then Radiator will look for a certificate revocation list (CRL) 
		# for the certificate issuer
		# when authenticating each client. If a CRL file is not found, or
		# if the CRL says the certificate has neen revoked, the authentication will 
		# fail with an error:
		#   SSL3_GET_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE:no certificate returned
		# One or more CRLs can be named with the EAPTLS_CRLFile parameter.
		# Alternatively, CRLs may follow a file naming convention: 
		#  the hash of the issuer subject name 
		# and a suffix that depends on the serial number.
		# eg ab1331b2.r0, ab1331b2.r1 etc.
		# You can find out the hash of the issuer name in a CRL with
		#  openssl crl -in crl.pem -hash -noout
		# CRLs with tis name convention
		# will be searched in EAPTLS_CAPath, else in the openssl 
		# certificates directory typically /usr/local/openssl/certs/
		# CRLs are expected to be in PEM format.
		# A CRL files can be generated with openssl like this:
		#  openssl ca -gencrl -revoke cert-clt.pem
		#  openssl ca -gencrl -out crl.pem
		# Use of these flags requires Net_SSLeay-1.21 or later
		#EAPTLS_CRLCheck
		#EAPTLS_CRLFile %D/certificates/crl.pem
		#EAPTLS_CRLFile %D/certificates/revocations.pem
		
		# Some clients, depending on their configuration, may require you to specify
		# MPPE send and receive keys. This _will_ be required if you select
		# 'Keys will be generated automatically for data privacy' in the Funk Odyssey
		# client Network Properties dialog.

		# You can configure the User-Name that will be used for the inner
