Cisco VPN 3000 Concentrator Groups

This is a brief article about how Cisco VPN group selection can be forced by a
RADIUS server such as Radiator on Cisco VPN 3000 concentrators

Some Cisco VPN concentrators can suport multiple VPN groups. When a user
wishes to connect to a VPN, the VPN concentrator sends a RADIUS Access-Request
to the RADIUS server.

If there are multiple VPN groups configured on the concentrator, there is _no_
indication of which VPN group the user desires to use in the RADIUS Access-Request.

However the RADIUS server can indicate which group a user should be placed in
by setting the Class attribute (25) in the Access-Accept.

The format of the Attribute should be:

Class="OU=vpnname;"

where vpnname is the name of the desired VPN group.

If the Access-Accept Class does not contain a valid VPN name, the user will be
placed in the default VPN group.

A logical consequence of the Cisco behaviour is that it is not possible for a
given user to have access to multiple VPN groups at their discretion, since at
the time of connection, there is no indication of whaich of possibly several
VPN groups the user desires.

The RADIUS server has no alternative except to request the group configured
for that user. This means that a given user can only have authenticated access
to at most on VPN group at a time. This is not a RADIUS server limitation, but
a Cisco limitaiton.
