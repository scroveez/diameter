# optigold.cfg
#
# Example Radiator configuration file.
# This simple configuration file shows how
# you can work with Optigold ISP (www.digitalpoint.com>
#
# Optigold works interoperates with Radiator through flat files:
# There is a flat users file that is generated with 
# Maintenance->Server Stuff->Generate RADIUS file. This file is created
# by default in c:\Program Files\Optigold ISP\authent.txt. This
# config file is designed to use that file in the standard place. 
# Note that you can also get Optigold to FTP this users file to 
# a different Radius server host. Thta host could also be a Unix 
# or Windows host running Radiator.
#
# In order the get Optigold to generate a correct users file
# you will need to slightly alter the default Radius configuration
# provided with Optigold. Click the 'Config' button next to
# "Generate RADIUS File" on the 
# Maintenance->Server Stuff. The first line in column 2 reads:
# Password = "<Pass>",
# Delete the comma from the end so it reads:
# Password = "<Pass>"
# and then click back.
# 
#
# Radius accounting data must be preprocessed before importing 
# into Optigold. The Radius_Parse by Stathy Touloumis, provided
# on the Optigold web site support area (www.digitalpoint.com/support)
# can parse the Radius detail file produced by Radiator.
# This config file will log accounting to 
# c:\Program Files\Optigold ISP\radius. Stathy's scripts can 
# read, parse and rotate that file to produce amn Optigold
# import file. You may need to alter the usrmon.cf file provided
# with Stathy's scripts in order to point it at the right files.
#
# You should consider this file to be a starting point only
