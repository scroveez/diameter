This document discusses Novell eDirectory and Universal Passwords.
It gives installation tips and configuration assistance.

Novell eDirectory is an LDAP accessible user directory. It can be used to
hold information about users, passwords, computers and other objects
in your network. It is most often used to control access to networks of
Windows computers.

eDirectory runs on Windows, Linus, Solaris and HPUX. It provides an
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server interface which
Radiator can use to search for and find users in order to control
dialup, wired and wireless network access.

Most LDAP servers prevent direct access to users passwords via LDAP,
so authenticating with an LDAP server in the past has meant storing a
separate per-user password field that can be fetched by LDAP, or else
getting the LDAP server to authenticate the password using
ServerChecksPassword.

Recently, Novell has added 'Universal Password' to
eDirectory. Universal Passsword is a mechanism where each user has
just one password to control access to all the systems that are
regulated by eDirectory.

Radiator can be configured to fetch the Universal Password in
plaintext from eDirectory, and can therefore be used to authenticate
a wide range of authentication protocols such as PAP, CHAP, MSCHAP,
MSCHAPV2, PEAP-MSCHAP, EAP-MSCHAP, EAP-MD5 etc. This is an improvement
over Windows Active Directory, where it is impossible to recover the
user's plaintext password from AD via LDAP, and thereore can only be
used with PAP and TTLS-PAP using LDAP.

Thie means that Radiator can be used to authenticate almost all dialup,
wired and wireless network access with the same password that users
use for local machine login, providing a better 'single signon'
environment than used to be the case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring Radiator to connect to eDirectory from Unix

Radiator running on Unix can be configured to connect using AuthBy
LDAP2 to eDirectory running on any platform, on the same host, locally
or remotely. It can be configured with the GetNovellUP to fetch each users
Universal Password and there to authenticate most type of Raditor
authentication request.

Prerequisites are:
Perl 3.6 or later
Radiator 3.11 plus patches or later
perl-ldap module (provides Net::LDAP)
IO::Socket::SSL Perl module (www.cpan.org)
openssl 0.9.7 or later
If EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS or PEAP support is required, Net::SSLeay Perl
  module (www.cpan.org)

See goodies/edirectory.cfg and goodies/eap_edir_up.cfg for example
configurations for connecting Radiator to eDirectory. We strongly
suggest you start with one of these samples when developing your
Radiator configuration. There is extensive documentation about each
option in these example config files. Start with these and change them
to suit your requirements, as they will proabably work with your system
with very few changes.

By default eDirectory only permits TLS LDAP connections, so you will
need to configure Radiator to use TLS before it can connect to
eDirectory, whether or not you wish to use Universal Passwords.

Therefore you _must_ export the export the eDirectory LDAP server root
certificate and convert it to PEM format as described below. You must
then edit your Radiator configuration and set SSLCAFile to the full
path name to your root certificate file in PEM format.

You will also need to edit your config file to suit the way you
installed and configured eDirectory: set the AuthDN and
AuthPassword to the DN and password for your eDirectory
administrator. You will also have to set BaseDN to the top of the LDAP
directory tree that contains all your users.

(If you do not wish to give the eDirectory administrator password out
for use in the Radiator configuration, you can instead create a new
user that Radiator will use to connect to eDirectory. Using iManager,
create a new user, with a CN of, say 'radiusadmin'. Using
Rights->Rights To Other Objects specify that radiusadmin is a Trustee
for the container holding the users to be authenticated (the container
could be the top level O=YOURORGNAME or any other group containing
your users). Make sure the assigned rights of the radiusadmin trustee
include both 'Read' and 'Write'.)

You should now be able to run Radiator to connect to eDirectory:
  radius -config goodies/edirectory.cfg -trace 4
and use radpwtst to test authentication
  radpwtst -noacct -user username -password userspassword
where username and userspassword are the user and password you
created above.
If you have problems, send your configuration file and the trace level
4 output from Radiator to the Radiator mailing list.

Installing eDirectory

These instructions are for eDirectory 8.8 SP5 with iManager 2.7, current at
2010-11-20 and the VASCO_NMAS_Method_3.4_iMan27.zip with novell-radius-ldap-extensions-1.1.0-3.zip

There are some mildy helpful documents here: 
http://www.novell.com/documentation/edir_radius/pdfdoc/radiusadmin/radiusadmin.pdf
http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/assets/freeradius-edir.pdf
but the following instructions are more explicit. 

We tested with SLES 11 on VMWare.

In these instructions, OPEN is the tree and OSC is the context. The Admin
username is 'admin' and their password is 'admin'. Modify these to suit your
organisation.

0. Make sure the proposed eDirectory server host you have internet access,
   static IP address and internal and external DNS host name assigned correctly
   (else server certificate will have wrong name and must disable cert verify
   with SSLVerify none)

1. If you are installing on SLES 11 or similar, you will require the compat-2009
   package. If you have SLES suport, install it from the SLES-EXtras repository,
   else you can get it from
http://www.eksiegowosc.com/repo/$RCE/SLES11-Extras/sle-11-i586/rpm/i586/

2. The NDS distribution might be in a tarball or a disk. Unpack the tarball or
   mount the disk. cd to the distribution

3. Install eDirectory 2.7.4:
sh nds-install
ndsconfig new -t OPEN -n o=OSC -a cn=admin.o=OSC
> enter password for admin: admin

4. Install iManager 2.7:
tar zxvf iMan_27_linux.tgz
cd iManager/installs/linux
sh iManagerInstallLinux.bin
(ensure you enter the same admin.OSC.OPEN from above as the qualified user)
When asked about installing plugins, as for: 9, radius, nmas, password
management, novell certificate server, nmas plugins

5. With a modern browser such as Firefox, browse to port 8443 on the eDirectory server:
eg https://linux-no66.site:8443/nps/
log in with the details of the Admin user you entered above 
eg admin.OSC, admin, OPEN
You should then be in iManager

6. Extract the self-signed server Root certificate (The certificate is
   required to connect to the TLS secured LDAP port):
In iManager:
Directory administration->Modify Object, browse to Security->OPEN CA, OK,
Certificates Tab, select Self Signed Certificate, Export. Disable 'Export
private key'. Export Format DER, Next>>, 'Save the exported certificate'. Get
cert.der

7. Convert the self-signed server Root certificate to PEM format (the format
Radiator requires)
openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in cert.der -out cert.pem        

8. Configure iManager and eDirectory:
In iManager: 
Passwords->Password Policies, Sample Password Policy observer Universal Passwords are enabled
 click on universal Password tab enable 'Allow Admin to retrieve Passwords' OK
In iManager: 
Passwords->Password Policies, Sample Password Policy 
 click on Policy Assignments tab browse to OSC, select, OK. Should then see Assignments: OSC
add a user, set the password

9. Configure Radiator for universal passwords, SSLCAFile cert.pem from above, see
   the sample goodies/edirectory.cfg in the Radiator distribution.


10. To enable the freeradius compatible RADIUS schema:
In iManager: 
Schema->Delete Class, RADIUS::Profile, OK (else plugin schema wont load
without conflicts, see radiusadmin.pdf 4.1.2 scenario 1)
import the .der certificate from above into Java (else cant install the scema)
keytool -import -file cert.der -keystore /opt/novell/jdk1.6.0/jre/lib/security/cacerts
restart tomcat:
/etc/init.d/novell-tomcat5 restart
In iManager: 
Radius->Extend Schema->OK

11. Install more NMAS methods for various types of authentications:
In iManager:
NMAS->NMAS Login Methods->New browse to one of the zip files in
nmas/NmasMethods/Novell/ in your eDirectory distribution (or in
novell-nmas-methods.i386.rpm) which also comes with the distribution.
rpm -Uvh  novell-nmas-methods.i386.rpm
The zip files will be installed in /opt/novell/nmas/nmasmthd/

12. To install the Vasco NMAS method, download the method module
http://www.vasco.com/large_download/Downloads/VASCO_NMAS_Method_3_4_iMan27.zip
follow the instructions included

13. Ask Novell for novell-radius-ldap-extensions-1.1.0-3.i586.rpm
and radauth_ldapxtn.ldif files. The installation of these files is described
in
http://www.novell.com/documentation/edir_radius/pdfdoc/radiusadmin/radiusadmin.pdf
however, the files are not readily available. Novell say they wil be included
in the distribution in the future but at the time of writing they were only
available through a service request to Novell. Follow the instructions in
radiusadmin.pdf to install novell-radius-ldap-extensions-1.1.0-3.i586.rpm,
modify and load radauth_ldapxtn.ldif and to restart the LDAP server.

The following instructions are for an older version of 
eDirectory and are obsolete at 2010-11-20

Follow these steps to install and configure eDirectory 8.7.3. You
_must_ install the 8.7.3.4 patches, otherwise eDirectory will suffer
from mysterious crashes, hangs etc. Detailed install instructions for
RedHat 9 and similar Linux hosts are installed below.

$ /etc/init.d/novell-tomcat4 start
$ /etc/init.d/novell-httpd start


6. Using ConsoleOne->My World->NDS->YOURTREEENAME->Your Organsiation->SSLCertificateDNS, 
   export the eDirectory LDAP server root certificate in DER format.

7. Using openssl convert to root certificate to PEM form:
   openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in TrustedRootCert.der -out TrustedRootCert.pem
   You will need the file TrustedRootCert.pem later when you configure Radiator.

8. Using iManager->Password Manager->Manage Password Policies, create
   a Passsword Policy that includes:
   'Enable Universal Password'
   'Allow user agent to retrieve password'
   'Allow password retrieval by admin'.
   (Your version of Password Manager may not include the 'Allow
   password retrieval by admin' option. If not see below.)

If your version of Password Manager does not include the 'Allow
   password retrieval by admin' option, you will have to set that flag
   using ConsoleOne. Caution: hex arithmetic required.

-. Run ConsoleOne with
   $ C1_JRE_HOME=/opt/novell/java/ /usr/ConsoleOne/bin/ConsoleOne
-. Select treename->Security->Password Policies
-. Select the password policy currently in force (Im using 'Sample Password Policy')
-. Click on the Other tab
-. Select nspmConfigurationOptions
-. Change the value of the nspmConfigurationOptions bitmask according to 
 http://www.directory-info.com/Java/Passwords/nspm.sch, so that the 
 'Allow password retrieval by admin' bit (0x20) is set on. Mine was changed from decimal 852 (=0x354) 
 to decimal 884 (=0x374). Setting the admin bit is the same as adding
 decimal 32 to nspmConfigurationOptions.

9. Assign the new Password Policy to the appropriate object or group
   in your eDirectory. We set it to the top of the tree o=OSC. IN your
   case you could use o=YOURORGNAME

10.Using iManager->Users->Create User, create a new user, but dont
   specify a password yet.

11.Using iManager->Password Management->Set Universal Password, choose
   the new user and set their Universal Password
