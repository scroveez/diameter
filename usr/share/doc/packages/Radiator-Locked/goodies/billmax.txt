Radiator works fine with BillMax, and can be configured to work 
either directly or indirectly with BillMax.

Indirect:

Radiator works with users files exported from BillMax with the gen_radius
program (see the BillMax docs for more details), and with accounting
detail files imported into BillMax with radparse.

Radiator can also be configured to proxy to the BillMax Radius server.

Direct:
Radiator can be used to integrate directly with BillMax. This means that
Radiator will query directly to the BillMax MySQL database. You would
do this if you wanted to use Radiator instead of the radius server
provided with BillMax. You might want to use Radiator instead of the
BillMax radius server becasue Radiator provides many more and more
sophisticated features than their Merit variant.

When you use Radiator directly with BillMax, you can run Radiator either
on the same host as BillMax, or on one or more other hosts. 
In either case, you need to install perl, DBI and DBD-mysql on the 
Radiator host, followed by Radiator.

Hint: If you install DBD-myql from RedHat rpms, you may also
have to install the mysql rpms. If you do that you _must_ remove the 
/etc/my.cnf that is installed by the mysql rpm. If you dont you will be 
_unable_ to start the BillMax MySQL server, eg:

rpm -Uvh mysql-3.23.36-1.i386.rpm   
rpm -Uvh mysql-devel-3.23.36-1.i386.rpm      
rpm -Uvh perl-DBD-MySQL-1.2215-1.i386.rpm 
rm -f /etc/my.cnf   

Hint:
The BillMax MySQL server is configured to use /tmp/mysql.sock as its Unix
socket.

There is an example Radiator configuration file billmax.cfg that
will work with BillMax on the same host as Radiator:

   perl radiusd -config_file goodies/billmax.cfg trace 4  

This config file assumes that you have not defined any Termianl Servers,
but rather that you have defined Resource 1 to 
represent dialup permission, and that the dialup Service has that Resource
enabled, and that all your dialup users have the dialup Service.

So to test with BillMax, you need to:

1. Install BillMax.
2. Start BillMax,
3. Using the BillMax web interface, Settings menu, create a Resource
   number 1.
4. Under Settings menu, create a Service Definition, with the Resouce
   you created above.
5. Create an Account with a User, who has the Service you created above.


If you are using a different Resource numbr for dialup, or if you
have different resource numbers for different types of Radius
controlled services, you can change the AuthSelect in billmax.cfg to suit.
A Resource is basically a bit in the service.resources bitmask, where resource
1 is the least significant bit, resource 2 is bit 2 etc.

For example, if you want to permit users only if they have a service with
Resource 3, you would need to change your AuthSelect to something like:

	AuthSelect	select d02 from service, user, account \
	where service.d01=%0 \
	and (service.resources & 8) != 0 \
	and service.user = user.number \
	and user.account = account.number \
	and account.state = 0 \
	and user.state = 0 \
	and service.state = 0


If you wish to use the configured Terminal Server entries to define
what services to use, you could use an AuthSelect like this:

AuthSelect  service.d02, service.number \
FROM service,termservers WHERE service.d01=%0 AND \
service.state=0 AND service.resources&termservers.resources \
AND termservers.ipnum='%N' ORDER BY number
