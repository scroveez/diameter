1) Install MacPorts on the host that will run Radiator.

2) After purchasing Radiator, download the Radiator tarball and copy it to /opt/local/var/macports/distfiles/radiator where the radiator Portfile is going to look for it.

3) Copy the radiator Portfile from goodies/Portfile to any directory, for example ~/radport/Portfile

4) Change to ~/radport (or wherever you copied the Portfile), edit the Portfile version to match the tarball version number, and execute the command 'sudo port install'.

Note:  To upgrade to a new version of Radiator, simply change to the directory containing the Radiator Portfile and execute:
       'sudo port uninstall' and 'sudo port clean --all' and repeat steps 3 and 4.


After the Portfile finishes, Radiator and all prerequisites are installed.  See the directions below for configuring, testing, and setting Radiator for continuous background operation (these instructions are also displayed after the port is installed).


A) Configure and test Radiator:

  -Copy an appropriate sample config file from ${prefix}/etc/radiator/goodies to ${prefix}/etc/radiator/radius.cfg

  -Modify the config file to your needs

  -Test Radiator in the foreground:
        cd ${prefix}/etc/radiator
        sudo -config_file radius.cfg
                                
B) Start/stop Radiator and continuous background operation:
                             
  -Use this command to start Radiator and enable the LaunchD script (LaunchD starts Radiator at system boot)
        sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.radiator.plist
                                
  -Use this command to stop the Radiator background process and disable the LaunchD script (disable starting at system boot)
        sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.radiator.plist

  -Check to verify that Radiator is running in the background with this command:
        ps -ax |grep radiusd

NOTE:  For OS X 10.3 and earlier versions, a startup item was created in /Library/StartupItems.  Add "RADIUS=-YES-" to the /etc/hostconfig file to run Radiator at system boot.
