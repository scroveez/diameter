These instructions show how to build Heimdal Kerberos (http://www.h5l.org/)
and set up a simple Kerberos KDC and test user database with test user:
- a service principal radiator@OPEN.COM.AU for Radiator to run as
- a user principal mikem@OPEN.COM.AU to test RADIUS authentication against
(you may want to change the Kerberos realm we used 'OPEN.COM.AU' to suit your needs)
In this test case, Radiator and the Kerberos KDC are on the same host. A
production Radiator architecture and configuration may be different.
Tested with heimdal-1.5.1

Based in part from:
http://www.h5l.org/manual/HEAD/info/heimdal/Creating-the-database.html#Creating-the-database

build and install heimdal-1.5.1 or later from source
cd .../heimdal-1.5.1
./configure
make
# as root:
make install
(installs to /usr/heimdal by default, you can change this with args to
configure above)

Create /etc/krb5.conf with contents something like this (OPEN.COM.AU is the
Kerberos test realm, zulu.open.com.au is the host running the KDC and optionally
kadmind).

# As normal user, in the Radiator directory
# set up the keytab file for a preauth as radiator@OPEN.COM.AU. Do this once

# use the preauth keytab to run Radiator with the sample Radiator
#  configuration which will authenticate PAP, EAP-MD5, EAP-MSCHAPV2
kinit --keytab=/tmp/radiator.keytab radiator ./radiusd -config goodies/heimdaldigest.cfg

# Test user authentication of mikem with password we created above using
# PAP
./radpwtst -noacct -user mikem@OPEN.COM.AU -password mikemspasswordasaenteredabove
#  EAP-MD5

# when you are finished, clean up and delete test databases and keytabs
killall kdc
rm -rf /var/heimdal/*
rm /tmp/radiator.keytab


# Hint: you can set up a separate Kerberos principals specially for Radiator logins
# so you dont have to use your regular Kerberos password. 
# To do this, use kadmin to create a different principal for, say, ppp logins:
# mikem/ppp@OPEN.COM.AU

# Hint: Radiator also ships with AuthBy KRB5, which will work with *any*
# Kerberos server, but is limited for technical reasons to supporting PAP and
# TTLS-PAP.  AuthBy HEIMDALDIGEST only works with Heimdal Kerberos, but
# supports a wider range of types of authentication, including PAP,
# EAP-MSCHAPV2, EAP-MD5 (and TTLS and PEAP equivalents)
