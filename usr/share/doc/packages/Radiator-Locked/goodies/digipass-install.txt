This document describes how to install and configure support for Vasco
Digipass tokens in Radiator.

Introduction
------------

Vasco (http://www.vasco.com) supply harware tokens for
one-time-password and two factor authentication. The device displays a
password which changes every minute, and which can be used to log on
to dialup, wireless or wired networks. Each token has a unique serial
number and other information associated with it.

Radiator includes the AuthBy SQLDIGIPASS authentication module which can
authenticate Vasco Digipass tokens. AuthBy SQLDIGIPASS requires the
Authen-Digipass module to be installed on the Radiator
host. Authen-Digipass is a precompiled Perl module that contains the
Vasco Controller software necessary for Digipass
authentication. Authen-Digipass is available for Solaris Sparc, Linux
x86and Windows platforms. This document includes instructions for
obtaining and installing Authen-Digipass.

AuthBy SQLDIGIPASS also requires an SQL database to hold information
about each Digipass token that your system knows about. When you
purchase a Digipass token from Vasco, you will also be supplied with a
DPX file that contains important data about the token. This DPX file must be
imported into the AuthBy SQLDIGIPASS database before the token can be
authenticated by Radiator. You can use any free or commercial SQL
database with AuthBy SQLDIGIPASS.

Acquiring Digipass tokens
-------------------------

Digipass tokens can be acquired from your local Vasco distributor. 
See https://www.vasco.com/buy/where_to_buy/buy.aspx

You can order tokens in small or large quantities. Caution: when you order
tokens to work with your Radiator system, you do not need to include fees for
the Vasco server, but you *do* need to include the 'Digipass User Data
Subscription Fee' (DUD) option, as well as the cost of the basic token. The
DUD is in effect the Vasco license fee for the Vasco compatibility API.

You will receive from Vasco a DPX file for each token or batch of tokens,
which is the data you need to import into the Radiator Digipass database in
order to authenticate those tokens. If you do not order the DUD option, you
will not receive the DPX files, and therefore the tokens will not be able to
be used.


Types of Digipass systems
-------------------------

AuthBy SQLDIGIPASS can be configured in several ways including:

1. As a simple stand-alone system. A single SQL table contains
   information about each Digipass token and the user it is assigned
   to. You can use the digipass.pl program supplied with
   Authen-Digipass to import tokens, assign them to users and
   otherwise administer tokens and users. The example digipass.cfg
   Radiator configuration file shows a simple example of how to
   configure Radiator for such a system. Sample SQL database table
   definition files are provided with Radiator for a range of free and
   commercial SQL databases.

2. As an addition to a Radiator-compatible user-management system or
   ISP billing system. In this mode, Radiator is configured to
   authenticate using AuthBy SQLDIGIPASS from an SQL table, but also uses
   other information from the user-management system to save usage
   data, get user- or service-specific Radius reply items etc.

3. In conjunction with OSC's RAdmin Radius user management system
   (http://www.open.com.au/radmin). RAdmin provides an
   easy-to-install, easy-to-use web-based graphical system for
   managing Radius users for dialup, wired and wireless
   authentication. RAdmin version 1.9 includes support for importing,
   allocating and administering Digipass tokens for authenticating
   users against Digipass tokens instead of static passwords. RAdmin
   also works with any free or commercial SQL database.


Installing Authen-Digipass on Linux
-----------------------------------

This Radiator distribution includes a precompiled binary RPM of
Authen-Digipass module suitable for use with Perl 5.8.0 or later on
Linux Intel x86 and x86 platforms.

Prior to this step, you will need to instal the Perl DBI and DBD
modules suitable for your selected SQL database. Full source for those
modules is available from your nearest CPAN archive
(http://www.cpan.org). Many Linux distributions have precompiled
biaries availabel for DBI and DBD.

# cd to your Radiator 3.9 (plus patches) or later distribution directory
cd blah/blahblah/Radiator-3.9
# install the RPM (as root). See goodies/README for all available RPMs.
su root
rpm -Uvh goodies/Authen-Digipass-1.11-1.el6.x86_64.rpm

# Following assumes you will use MySQL for your test database:
# Create a sample MySQL database and test user 'mikem'
# (you may also need to specify the MySQL root username and password)
mysql <<EOF
CREATE DATABASE radius;
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,INDEX,LOCK TABLES,CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON radius.* TO mikem@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'fred';
EOF
mysqladmin reload
# Create a number tables useful for testing Radiator
mysql -umikem -pfred radius <goodies/mysqlCreate.sql

# Now import a token using the digipass.pl program that
# comes with Authen-Digipass. Requires
# a DPX file from Vasco for your token
digipass.pl import nnnnnnn.dpx
# The import will print the serial number(s) of the token(s) it imported:
#   imported '0097123456APPL 1      '
# Now assign the token to a user.
# Make sure you use the token serial number printed during the import
digipass.pl assign '0097123456APPL 1      ' mikem

# Now run Radiator so it uses the Digipass authenticator
perl radiusd -config goodies/digipass.cfg

# And test it from another window, where 999999 is
# the number currently displayed on your Digipass token.
cd blah/blahblah/Radiator-3.9
perl radpwtst -noacct -user mikem -password 999999

The digipass.pl program also provides a number of other token
administration features. Type
digipass.pl -h
for usage help.

Installing Authen-Digipass on Windows
-----------------------------------

This Radiator distribution includes a precompiled binary PPM of
Authen-Digipass module suitable for use with ActiveState
(http://www.activestate.com) ActivePerl or Strawberry Perl on
Windows Intel x86 platforms.

# cd to your Radiator 3.9 (plus patches) or later distribution directory
cd blah\blahblah\Radiator-3.9
ppm install ppm\Authen-Digipass.ppd

# Now create an SQL database and tables using your preferred SQL
#  database. It wil be convenient for testing if the database is called
# 'radius', the test user is called 'mikem' with password 'fred',
# however, other combinations can be accomodated using the dbsource,
# dbusername and dbauth arguments to digipass.pl

.... whatever....

# Now create the sample tables, using one of the scripts in
# goodies\*.sql and your preferred SQL database utilities.

.... whatever.... 


# Now import a token using the digipass.pl program that
# comes with Authen-Digipass. Requires
# a DPX file from Vasco for your token
digipass.pl import nnnnnnn.dpx
# The import will print the serial number(s) of the token(s) it imported:
#   imported '0097123456APPL 1      '
# Now assign the token to a user.
# Make sure you use the token serial number printed during the import
digipass.pl assign '0097123456APPL 1      ' mikem

# Now run Radiator so it uses the Digipass authenticator
perl radiusd -config goodies/digipass.cfg

# And test it from another window, where 999999 is
# the number currently displayed on your Digipass token.
cd blah\blahblah\Radiator-3.9
