After searching through your mailing list to find out if I could enable a
"preauth" type situation whereby users dialing into an Ascend TNT NAS could
be set to CHAP or PAP based on the Called-Station-Id attribute.  I noticed a
reply by Hugh to someone saying it is NAS configured and not Radiator
configured.  This is not entirely true - I have just got it working and it
involves SOME NAS configuration but I have been able to get Radiator to
check if the user should be using PAP or CHAP and then send this information
to the TNT to setup the PPP connections.  All of this get's done while the
modems are still negotiating so the end user doesn't see any delays.
Remember this particular setup is COMPLETELY based on <Handler
Called-Station-ID=...> so it worked fine for us but another setup with realm
based authentication may be a little different.  I'm only sending this as
reference for yourself and possibly the mailing list but if you already know
then just disregard.

Configuration on TNT
********************
TNT must first be in VSA mode:
	read external-auth
	set rad-auth-client auth-radius-compat = vendor-specific

Then the TNT needs to use PreAuthentication
	read answer
	set clid-auth-mode = dnis-first
	An explaination of the DNIS modes are shown below:
		dnis-require:  	The Called # must be valid and match the value in the
stored
     					profile. If the profile also requires pap/chap/etc then do that in
     					addition.
 		dnis-pref:  	Authenticate using the Called # if provided by the telco
switch,
     					otherwise fall back to using the encapsulation protocol's
authentication.
     					If DNIS authentication fails, refuse the call.
 		dnis-first:  	First authenticate using the Called # if provided by the
telco
     					switch. If Called # authentication fails, fall back to using the
     					encapsulation protocol's authentication.

Configuration on Radiator
*************************
The TNT (after the above changes are made) then sends an Access-Request to
Radiator with User-Name=(Called-Station-Id) and User-Password=Ascend-DNIS.
You just need to add a Handler above the one used for the customer in
question matching on Called-Station-Id AND User-Name (same value).  For an
example of the Handler code see below:

<Handler Called-Station-Id=0293474101, User-Name=0293474101>
        <AuthBy FILE>
                Filename %D/papcustomers
        </AuthBy>
</Handler>
<Handler Called-Station-Id=0293474101>
        AuthByPolicy DoAll
	  stuff...
        <AuthBy SQL>
                stuff...
        </AuthBy>
        <AuthBy RADIUS>
                stuff...
	  </AuthBy>
</Handler>

And the contents of the 'papcustomers' file is shown below:

0293474101      Called-Station-Id=0293474101, User-Password="Ascend-DNIS"
 Ascend-Require-Auth=Require-Auth,
 Ascend-Auth-Type=3

You must also edit your dictionary to include the line:
VENDORATTR 529       Ascend-Auth-Type                 81     integer

The reply-items setup PAP/CHAP/MS-CHAP/etc...  And the allowed value are
listed below:

Auth-Non (0) specifies that no tier-2 name and password authentication is
required. Specifying this value has the same 			effect as setting
Ascend-Require-Auth to Not-Require-Auth.
Auth-Default (1) specifies that the connection uses the Receive-Auth-Mode
setting.
Auth-Any (2) specifies that the connection must use PAP, CHAP or MS-CHAP.
Auth-PAP (3) specifies that the connection must use PAP.
Auth-CHAP (4) specifies that the connection must use CHAP.
Auth-MS-CHAP (5) specifies that the connection must use MS-CHAP.

We have only needed this functionality because when Radius Proxied customers
dialup using Win95/98/etc, Microsoft in their infinite wisdom try CHAP first
then PAP.  As we want the TNT to support both we can't just disable one.
Hence we need to set PAP/CHAP based on Called-Station-Id.

Anyway hope this was actually helpful and not too long-winded and boring...

Cheers
