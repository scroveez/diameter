Radiator 2.16 includes the ability for check items to match
in the currenly contstructed reply, as well as the current request.
If a check item begins with the string Reply: the match
is done against the named attribtue in the current reply. This
allows you to refer to the contents of partly constructed
replies.

This document is a brief description of how you can implement user
profiles using check items that refer to reply attributes.

Assume that you want to maintain a number of user 'profiles',
sets of Radius reply attribtues that depend on the type of
account that the user has purchased. For example, a premium account
might have a very long session timeout, and a cheaper account, 
a shorter Session-Timeout.

You can implement this as follows. In your user authentication
module, you set a pseudo reply item called Profile. And then in
a following module, you have a number of DEFAULT users check
the Profile attribute in the currently contructed _reply_. Finally
you strip out the pseudo attribtue Profile before the real reply
goes back to the nas.

It should be noted that while this example uses FILE to hold
the users and thier profiles, it could in fact be implemented with
any other authentiocaitonm moduiles, like SQL, LDAP etc.

Here is a sample extract from a Radiator configuration file:

...
<Realm DEFAULT>
	AuthByPolicy ContinueWhileAccept
	# This file checks passwords and sets the Profile
	# in the reply
	<AuthBy FILE>
		Filename ./users
	</AuthBy>

	# Now add some real reply attributes that depend on the 
	# Profile attribute added above, then strip the Profile
	<AuthBy FILE>
		Filename ./profiles
		# Remove the Profile Pseudo attribute added
		# above
		StripFromReply Profile
	</AuthBy>
</Realm>


And in the users authentication file:

u1	Password=u1
	Profile=premium

u2	Password=u2
	Profile=premium

u3	Password=u3
	Profile=cheap


And in the profiles file:

# Adds a session timeout that depends on the profile
DEFAULT	Reply:Profile=cheap
	Session-Timeout = 100

DEFAULT	Reply:Profile=premium
	Session-Timeout = 200
