Hi,

FYI

I've added a little code to add a "milliseconds" report to the log file.
You need to download and install the Time-HiRes-01.20.tar.gz package which
can be downloaded from CPAN.

Then, a small adjustment to LogFILE.pm,

(at the beginning of the module)

use Time::HiRes qw( usleep ualarm gettimeofday tv_interval );

(in sub log)

sub log
{
    my ($self, $p, $s) = @_;

my $seconds;
my $micro;

    if ($p <= $self->{Trace})
    {
        ($seconds, $micro) = gettimeofday;

        my $ctime = localtime(time);
        my $message = "$ctime.$micro: $Radius::Log::priorityToString[$p]:
$s\n";



This changes the output of the timestamping to

Fri Oct 13 12:57:01 2000.171639: DEBUG: Packet dump:

While the milliseconds are added after the year, they do at least give you
the ability to view with a lot more precision how long all steps are taking,
and if there is a delay occuring somewhere.

Regards,

Anton.
