This hook is designed for use with an AuthBy LDAP2 clause, to add a prefix of
"{nthash}" to the password string returned from the LDAP database.

The LDAP database has the user passwords stored in an encrypted form in an
attribute called "sambaNTPassword", which Radiator can deal with provided the
string has a prefix of "{nthash}".

The hook retrieves the "User-Password" from the internal user object being
created after the LDAP database is queried, and adds "{nthash}" to the
beginning of the string.
