Using Digipass tokens with Cisco VPN client and Cisco ASA VPN  
concentrator

Recently a customer contacted OSC requesting assistance with  
implementing Radiator in a VPN environment employing Cisco VPN products.

The Cisco products were the ASA VPN concentrator and the Cisco VPN  
client software for Windows.

The problem was the inability to use Digipass tokens due to the Cisco  
VPN client never receiving an access challenge.

Investigation revealed that when no password (ie. a null string) was  
entered into the Cisco VPN client, the RADIUS server actually  
received a password of one space character.

It was not clear whether the Cisco VPN client, or the Cisco ASA was  
substituting a space character for a null string.

The solution was to add a PreHandlerHook to the Radiator <Client ...>  
clause for the Cisco ASA device to check for a password of a single  
space character and replace it with a null string.

This allows Radiator to correctly identify the initial RADIUS request  
and issue the correct challenge.


Here is the code for the PreHandlerHook:

# removeSpacePassword
# PreHandlerHook to remove a single space password
# Hugh Irvine, OSC, 20081103

sub
{
     my $p = ${$_[0]};

     my $secret = $p->{Client}->{Secret};
     my $password = $p->get_attr('User-Password');
     my $decodedpassword = $p->decode_password($password, $secret);

     if ($decodedpassword eq ' ')
     {
         $password = $p->encode_password('', $secret);
         $p->change_attr('User-Password', $password);
         &main::log($main::LOG_DEBUG, 'User-Password changed');
     }

     return;
}
