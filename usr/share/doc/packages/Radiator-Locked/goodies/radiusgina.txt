RadiusGINA is a Windows RADIUS login authenticator from LSE
http://lsexperts.de

RadiusGINA is qualified for interoperation with Radiator.

It is easy to install on Windows XP and 200x, and combines external RADIUS
authentication with local Windows-based authentication. It is intended for use
with RADIUS One-Time-Password (OTP) based password protection schemes, such as
the many supported by Radiator), but can in fact be used with any RADIUS PAP
password authentication module.

After installation and activation on a Windows host, when a user wishes to log
on, RadiusGINA presents a custom GINA login dialog with

User name
Login to (machine name)
Password
OTP

When OK is clicked, the username and the OTP will be sent to the Radius server and be
verified there. Then the username and the windowspassword will be used
to aquire a ticket from AD and start a Desktop session.

The resulting RADIUS request contains the username and PAP password:

*** Received from 203.63.154.182 port 1027 ....
Code:       Access-Request
Identifier: 124
Authentic:  <252>t<233><25>"7<234>#<237><22><197>=<201><5><137><3>
Attributes:
        User-Name = "fred"
        User-Password = o<157>`<11><11><209><158><183><255>bm}~<1>$%


Radiator can authenticate that Access-Request in any PAP compatible way to
accept or reject the login.

RadiusGINA can be configured to send the User name as either:

Username
Domain\Username
Username@Domain

so it can be easily integrated with existing RADIUS authentication policies
and user databases.


LSExperts also publish a OTP product called LinOTP. 
Radiator can be configured to work with LinOTP, and LSExperts have published
