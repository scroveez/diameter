This is description of how to install Radiator on MAC OS X.

Radiator requires a recent version of Perl and at least the Perl
Digest-MD5 module. Other Perl modules may be required to interface to
other systems, such as SQL servers etc.

While Perl comes standard with your MAC OS X installation, Digest-MD5
may not be included, so the instructions below show how to do that
too.

1. Install the MacOS X Developer Tools CD. You will need the compilers
   and libraries that get installed from this CD to build Digets-MD5
   and any other perl modules you may need. The CD should have come
   with your MAC OS X distribution.

2. Download the Digest-MD5 package from
   http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Digest/Digest-MD5-2.23.tar.gz
   (or a later version) to a work directory, preferably into
   /usr/local/src

3. Unpack the Digest-MD5 package:

   $ cd /usr/local/src
   $ gzip -c -d  Digest-MD5-2.23.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   $ cd Digest-MD5-2.23

4. Build and install the Digest-MD5 package. This is the standard
   procedure for all Perl modules. Note that the 'make install' is
   done as root.

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ sudo make install

5. Download the latest Radiator source package from 
   http://www.open.com.au/radiator/downloads (licensed customers) or
   http://www.open.com.au/radiator/demo-downloads (evaluations only)
   to a work directory, preferably into /usr/local/src/Radiator.
   Username and password required for download.

6. Unpack the Radiator package (version 3.5 in this example):

   $ mkdir /usr/local/src/Radiator
   $ cd /usr/local/src/Radiator
   $ gzip -c -d  Radiator-3.5.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   $ cd Radiator-3.5

7. Build and install the Radiator package. 

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test   (you should lots of 'OK's and no 'not OK's)
   $ sudo make install

8. Create a Radiator data directory, and copy example configuration
   and data files to it. You will probably need to be root to do this.

   $ sudo su -
   # mkdir /etc/radiator
   # mkdir /var/log/radius
   # cp dictionary /etc/radiator
   # cp goodies/linux-radius.cfg /etc/radiator/radius.cfg
   # cp goodies/simple-users /etc/radiator/users

9. Run Radiator and test it:

   # radiusd -config /etc/radiator/radius.cfg -foreground \
     -log_stdout -trace 4

   in another window, run the Radiator test client:
   $ radpwtst -user mikem -password fred

   you should see:
   sending Access-Request...
   OK
   sending Accounting-Request Start...
   OK
   sending Accounting-Request Stop...
   OK


10. If all went well so far, edit /etc/radiator/radius.cfg to suit
   your site, using the Reference Manual in doc/ref.html in your
   distribution, and the sample configuration files in goodies (see
   goodies/README for a full list and descriptions).

11. When your Radiator is configured the way you want it arrange for it
   to start automatically at boot time. See goodies/INSTALL.MacOSX in
   your Radiator distribution.
