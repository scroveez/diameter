This document describes how to configure a Lancom L-54g wireless Access Point
to use RadSec to connect to an external RadSec server for authentication.

Use the L-54g web interface to log in and perform the following tasks

1. Update the firmware of the L-54g to version 7.56.0046 / 20.08.2008 or
   later.

2. Enable 802.1X wireless attributes as reqiured. Do not enable any RADIUS
   servers yet.

3. Install the Root Certificate of the CA that issued the RadSec servers
   certificate. 
   Go to Upload Certificate or File. 
   Select File Type RADSEC - Root CA Certificate
   Enter the name of the CA file
   Start Upload

4. Using a procedure similar to 3, upload the client certificate. If the
   client certificate is encrypted you can enter the passphrase required to
   decrypt the certificate. Select RADSEC -Device Certificate as the file
   type.

5. Using a procedure similar to 3, upload the private key of the client
   certificate. You can extract the private key from a PEM certificate with
   these commands:
   openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert-clt.pem -nodes -out my.pfx
   openssl pkcs12 -in my.pfx -out my-nodes.key -nodes -nocerts  
   When uploading, choose FIle Type: RADSEC - Device Private Key

6. The 3 uploaded certificate files should now appear in the 
   Expert Configuration -> Status -> File-System -> Contents page as
   radsec_rootcert, radsec_devcert and radsec_privkey.

7. Go to Expert Configuration -> Setup -> IEEE802.1x -> RADIUS-Server
   Add
   Enter the Name, address and port number of the external RadSec server. 
   In Secret, enter the same
   shared secret as is configured into the RadSec server. Select RADSEC for
   the protocol.

8. Now when an 802.1X client attempts to connect to the AP, a RadSec
   connection wil be established to the remote RadSec server, and the client
   will be authenticated using RADIUS requests passed over the RadSec
   connection. 


Hints:

1. You can enable Radius tracing on the L-54g by:
   log in via telnet or ssh to the L-54g, and run this command:
   trace + RADIUS

2. The default mode for the Physical wireless lan is "Managed (Access
   Point)". This will only work if you have a separate wireless lan manager. If
   you have a simple stand-alone wireless AP configuration, you probably want
   to choose WLAN OperationMode of "Access Point" in 
   Configuration->Wireless Lan -> Physical WLAN settings - Operation
